# tea_cozy

This project is The Tea Cozy Project from the Codecademy Ready Program.

In this project, students were required to create a fictional tea shop website on their own computer.

Codecademy provided a design spec and image assets. A design spec outlined with all of its CSS properties and values was also 
provided. 

Students were required to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS.

This is my version of the project.
